Coachable Take Home Assignment 1.
This assignment has 7 parts, please try to complete all of them. 
You should test your code by running it against basic inputs using print statements.
We recommend keeping your tests in the file when you submit - it helps us see your thought process.


Here are the sections needed for this assignment.

1.1 Your First Program
1.2 Built-in Types of Data
1.3 Conditionals and Loops
1.4 Arrays
2.1 Defining Functions
2.2 Modules and Clients
2.3 Recursion

Part 1. For Loops and Conditionals.
1. Print "Hello World"
2. Print the numbers 1-25
3. Print the odd numbers from 1-30 (inclusive)
4. Print Fizzbuzz to to 50. If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz". If the number if divisible by 3 and 5, then print "FizzBuzz". Otherwise print the number itself.
E.g. 1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz, 7,8,9,Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13,14,FizzBuzz,....

Part 2. Functions

5. Write a function that finds the maximum number in a list without using built-in max functions.



6. Write a function that returns the index of the max number in a list. Do not use the built-in index function.


Part 3. Recursion.
7. Write a function to compute the factorial. For example your function should behave as follows.
The factorial is N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (N-1) * N

factorial(5) = 120 because 5! = 120
factorial(3) = 6 becuase 3! = 3*2*1
factorial(0) = 1 by definition.
factorial(1) = 1 by definition. 
 
8. Write a recursive function to compute Fibonacci. Fibonacci is a sequence defined by 

fib(0) = 1, fib(1) = 1
then the next element in the sequence is the sum of the first 2.
So the sequence looks like
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,....

Write a recursive function to compute the Nth Fibonacci number.
